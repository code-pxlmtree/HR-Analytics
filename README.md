# HR-Analytics
## Executive Summary
This HR analytics project focuses on analysing a fictional company's employee data in order to uncover insights related to attrition, workforce demographics, compensation trends and job satisfaction.

In this project I demonstrate end-to-end analytics skills:
- Data cleaning in Microsoft Excel
- Data modeling and visualisation in Power BI
- Business insight generation for decision making

## Dataset:
The dataset was obtained on kaggle. It containes employee information from a fictional company. For those interested in viewing or downloading the dataset, it is available in my GitHub repository.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
These indicators show us a quick snapshot of the organisational culture. We look at total employees, attrition count, active employees. With only 237 out of 1 470 employees leaving during the year, the data suggests employees want to stay in the company.

### Employees by Gender
I created a pie chart of employees by gender which displays workforce distribution by gender. A good organisation makes it a priority to have a balance between male and female. The data shows that 60% of employees are male, and 40% are female. There is a 10% discrepency between the two genders. The company should make it a point of emphasis to hire more quality female employees. Diversity breeds a healthy organisational culture.
