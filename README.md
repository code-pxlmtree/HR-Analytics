# HR-Analytics
## Executive Summary
This HR analytics project focuses on analysing a fictional company's employee data in order to uncover insights related to attrition, workforce demographics, compensation trends and job satisfaction.

In this project I demonstrate end-to-end analytics skills:
- Data cleaning in Microsoft Excel
- Data modeling and visualisation in Power BI
- Business insight generation for decision making

## Dataset:
The dataset was obtained on kaggle. It containes employee information from a fictional company. For those interested in viewing or downloading the dataset, it is available in my GitHub repository.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
These indicators show us a quick snapshot of the organisational culture. We look at total employees, attrition count, active employees. With only 237 out of 1 470 employees leaving during the year, the data suggests employees want to stay in the company.

### Employees by Gender
I created a pie chart of employees by gender which displays workforce distribution by gender. A good organisation makes it a priority to have a balance between male and female. The data shows that 60% of employees are male, and 40% are female. There is a 10% discrepency between the two genders. The company should make it a point of emphasis to hire more quality female employees. Diversity breeds a healthy organisational culture.

### Average Monthly Income by Age Range
The bar graph showing the average monthly income by age shows that the older an employee is, the more experienced they are and as such the more monthly income they earn. In the company, after 45, the average monthly income seems to even out, which shows that the most an employee can realistically strive for is 10.2K - 10.5K. 

### Job Satisfaction Rating
The matrix shows job satisfaction across job roles. This can give the company information as to which roles have a low job satisfaction, thus prompting the company to address the issue. Sales executives have the highest job satisfaction rating with human resources showing the lowest rating. Strategies should be put in place in order to address human resources roles and plan for retention activities.

### What Drives Attrition?
Using Power BI's Key Influencers visual, the analysis identifies that when an employee's job involvement is 1 (on a scale of 1 to 4), then the likelihood of attrition increases by 2.24x. This tells us that when employees feel as though they are not involved at work or their work is being overlooked, they are more than 2 times likely to leave the company. Strategies should be put in place to combat low-job involvement, and develop a cohesive work environment.
